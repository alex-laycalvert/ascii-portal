# ascii-portal

A stupid simple implementation of something vaguely resembling the game Portal.

***NOTE***: While the initial version of the game *is* functional, I'm in the
process of refactoring the code and hopefully adding more features so this is a
work in progress.

## Installation and Running

On Linux (and macOS?):

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alex-laycalvert/ascii-portal.git

# Build using make
make

# Optionally build using gcc
gcc src/main.c -o portal

# Run
./portal

```

On Windows:

```bash
# Sorry
```
